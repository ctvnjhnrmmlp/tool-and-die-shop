# Tool and Die Shop

_Modern Ordering App_

**Built using TypeScript, React JS, Next JS, Next Auth, Dexie, and Formik**

Jobs are currently processed manually, starting with the establishment of a job number. The job supervisor then estimates time and materials, which is time-consuming and prone to delays. Subsequently, the job is scheduled for a specific day and time, with materials orders issued to stores accordingly.

On the scheduled day, materials orders must be fulfilled, and if materials are unavailable, rescheduling becomes necessary. Time cards are completed by workers in the shop upon fulfilling the work order. These time cards are used for both internal tracking and customer billing, processed manually and entered into the work order.

Work orders undergo accuracy checks and are forwarded to CIS for accounting records update and customer billing. However, the monthly reporting system results in customer inquiries about costs incurred, as real-time information is unavailable. Management lacks visibility into initial estimates' accuracy and work progress on tools, machines, and workers.

This comprehensive application aims to streamline operations, enhancing efficiency and transparency within the Tool and Die Shop.
